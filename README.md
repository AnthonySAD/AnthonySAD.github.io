## How to build
This blog project is cloned from [huxblog-boilerplate](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxblog-boilerplate).You can find a good instruction there.

The project is based on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="http://jekyll.com.cn/">Jekyll</a>.You don't need a private web server.It is very easy and cheap to build the blog web.
