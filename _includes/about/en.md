> Learning never later!

hi, guys. I am Anthony Shen, a PHP developer, work in a start-up company that located in Shanghai China. I change my profession and start learning programming in 2018 because I like the internet.

I rejoice for the decision I maid that time. Programming give me achievability and good feeling, satisfy my creating desire, improve my learing habit. In the recent year, I learnt a lot of knowledge and my horizons became broaden.

Now my current goal is being a software engineer, not a coding worker.
